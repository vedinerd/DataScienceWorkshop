"manifest", and "origin" respectively) are generated either before or at the moment the package is in the hands of the carrier.  The "EG" activity is an internal activity
irrelevant to us here. The "R" activity ("rescheduled") represents an expected rescheduling, which we also aren't interested in.  We also filter out packages that are either
before 2015 or were shipped in the last few days of the year.  This is to make sure our entire (or almost our entire) data set represents packages that were delivered in 2015,
